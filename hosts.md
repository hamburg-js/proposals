# Hosting a HH.js meetup

## Who can host a HH.js meetup?

We are thankful for every organisation or company that is willing to host our HH.js meetup!
Please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals#contact) if you would like to host a meetup.

## How many attendees can we expect?

Usually, there are about 30 - 50 people attending our meetup.
Your room and facilities (seating) must be able to accomodate this number.

## What are the non-technical requirements?

The venue needs to be accessible (signage and possibly access-control) from half an hour before the meetup starts and during breaks.

Sufficient non-alcoholic drinks and beer are highly appreciated. 

Some typical numbers from our last meetups:

- 4 crates of beer (including alcohol-free)
- 4 crates of soda (lemonade, including sugar-free)
- 2 crates of water (sparkling / non-sparkling)

## What are the technical requirements?

We expect you to provide WiFi, video projector(s) and ideally a microphone / audio setup.

For video connectivity, we expect the following cables / adapters:

- HDMI
- Mini DisplayPort
- USB-C

Please [contact us](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals#contact) if you can't provide everything on this list, but still want to host a meetup.
