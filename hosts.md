# Hosting a HH.js meetup

## Who can host a HH.js meetup?

We are thankful for every organisation or company that is willing to host our HH.js meetup!
Please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals#contact) if you would like to host a meetup.

## How many attendees can we expect?

Usually, there are about 80 - 100 people attending our meetup.
Your room and facilities (seating) must be able to accomodate this number.

## What are the non-technical requirements?

The venue needs to be accessible (signage and possibly access-control) from half an hour before the meetup starts and during breaks.

Sufficient non-alcoholic drinks and beer are highly appreciated. Since our meetup is focused on technical content and networking, we kindly ask you to refrain from providing food.

Some typical numbers from our last meetups:

- 4 crates of beer (including alcohol-free)
- 4 crates of soda (lemonade, including sugar-free)
- 2 crates of water (sparkling / non-sparkling)

## What are the technical requirements?

We expect you to provide WiFi, video projector(s) and ideally a microphone / audio setup.

For video connectivity, we expect the following cables / adapters:
- HDMI
- Mini DisplayPort
- USB-C

Please [contact us](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals#contact) if you can't provide everything on this list, but still want to host a meetup.

## What is the typical duration of a meetup?

Usually, attendees start arriving at 7pm, while the actual meetup starts at 7:30pm and ends before 10pm.

## Can we address the attendees?

You will have up to 5 minutes at the beginning of the meetup to present your organisation. Additionally you are welcome to socialise with our attendees during breaks.

_Current employees of hosts are not selected to give talks on the months of their employer's sponsorship._
