# Submitting A Talk

## Who can submit talks to HH.js?
We welcome and encourage _everyone_ to submit a talk!
Whether you have been writing JavaScript for 20 years or few days, experienced or 1st time speaker, we want to hear what you are excited about.

## How do I submit a talk?
Visit our proposals GitHub repository and [create a new issue](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template. Make sure to pick up to 3 months that work for you!

## What would be a good talk topic?
We accept a variety of technical and non-technical talks and the audience has varying technical backgrounds and interests.

Talks from accepted proposals are usually focused on, but not limited to:
- Sharing the process and journey of how you created something and what you've learned.
- Achieving empathy in the workplace.
- A dive into a particular technical concept.

Examples of topics that may not get accepted:
- Why x framework is better than y framework.
- Startup or company pitches.

 We've found that the best talks tell a story, we encourage you to get creative!

## When are speakers chosen?
We usually select speakers two weeks before an event.

:warning: _Current employees of hosts are not selected to speak on the months of their employer's sponsorship._
