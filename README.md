# HH.js Talk Proposals

If you would like to give a talk at [HH.js](https://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/), thank you very much! We really appreciate your willingness to put your time and effort into something that will make our meetup more interesting and inspiring.

## Proposals

If you want to give a feature talk (length: 20 minutes to maximum of 45 minutes), please [click here](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals/issues/new?template=feature-talk.md) to open an issue.\
If you want to give a lightning talk (length: 5 minutes to maximum of 15 minutes), please [click here](https://github.com/hamburg-js/proposals/issues/new?template=lightning-talk.md) to open an issue.

In that issue, we ask you to outline the topic of your talk and to pick a couple of possible dates (usually one of the upcoming events, it didn't work out too well to collect possible talks in advance for events not yet scheduled). 

## Upcoming Meetups

- December 12, 2023 at [Factorial](https://factorial.io). Call for proposal is officially opened ðŸ¥³
